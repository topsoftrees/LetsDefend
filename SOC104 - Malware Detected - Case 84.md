## Analysis
Going to Log Management, searching for the source IP of 172.16.17.5, pulls the below information.

Since the event time and date is months later than the alert, at a quick glance, the information in log management shows it's most likely not related. I'm not discounting the information just putting it on the back burner for now.

Going to Endpoint Management, searching for the source IP shows the last reported login was August 29, 2020, not near the time of the alert. The browser history, command history, network connections, and process list all show the host as being down.

Searching the reporting hash, source IP, and executable in Threat Intelligence does now show any results. 

In VirusTotal, the hash and exectuable does not report as being malicious. Cisco Talos reports as Neutal and HybridAnalysis as whitelisted.
